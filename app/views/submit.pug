  h2.title-hed Submit a Talk 
  p Submit your proposal to speak at BostonJS! 
  p A proposal can be just a 4-5 sentence paragraph, or it can be a full blown deck that you already have prepared. Just be sure to include a title and some sort of description, so we can understand what you plan to present. You can also choose how *long* you'd like to present for, as we know that certain topics and speakers have different time requirements!
  p We welcome - and encourage - folks with different levels of experience to submit talks! Even if you feel you are "new" or "just learning", consider submitting your idea, or talk to us at a meetup about it! We really believe that everyone in the community has something to offer everyone else in the community regardless of age, gender, race, sexual orientation, or skill level.
  p BostonJS expects all speakers and attendees to follow the 
    a(href="http://bocoup.com/community/conduct") Bocoup Code of Conduct.
